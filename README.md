## Main Interests

### ðŸ¤– Machine Learning (ML)
I enjoy the process of building models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions. I am interested in various algorithms, from simple linear regression to more sophisticated models like Random Forest and XGBoost.

### ðŸ§  Neural Networks (NN)
Neural networks are one of my favorite topics. I am fascinated by how these structures, inspired by the human brain, can be used to solve problems such as image recognition and natural language processing.

### ðŸ”¥ Deep Learning (DL)
As a sub-field of Machine Learning, Deep Learning opens doors to new possibilities. I am currently studying architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to process more complex data.
